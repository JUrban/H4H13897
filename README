This is the H4H13897 benchmark for automated reasoning in large theories (ARLT).

There are large 13897 problems in the benchmark in the directory
"problems". They are listed in the file ProblemsInProcessingOrder and
contain altogether 17221 formulas. The problems are created by
first-order export [1] of theorems and definitions from 125 HOL4 [2] files,
listed in FilesInProcessingOrder. Only theorems and definitions needed
by the files are exported. Version HOL4-Kananaskis-10 was used:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/kananaskis-10/kananaskis-10.tar.gz/download .

6811 of these large problems could be proved by the E.T. 0.1 ATP
system based on E prover, and 7845 were proved in total when E.T. was
also helped by axiom selection using the k-nearest neighbor machine
learning method [1] trained on other proofs.  All these 7845 proofs
are available in the directory proofs_ET.

Have fun!
